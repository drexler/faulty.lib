Faulty.lib is a dynamic linker with the ability to load libraries
from Zip archives. At the moment, it only works on ELF Linux systems.

You can build it with the following commands:
  autoreconf
  automake -a -c  (ignore any error message, it's only used to copy
                   config.guess and config.sub)
  ./configure
  make

Automated tests can be run with `make check'.

The result of a build is a static library that provides __wrap_dlopen,
__wrap_dlerror, __wrap_dlsym, __wrap_dlclose, __wrap_dladdr functions
with the same prototypes as the dl* family of functions.

Loading a library from a Zip archive is achieved by passing a specially
crafted path name to __wrap_dlopen.
Its form is `/path/to/file.zip!/subdir/library.so'.
